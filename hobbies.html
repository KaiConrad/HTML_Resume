                <h1> Hobbies</h1>
                <hr>
                <p> I have a lot of hobbies, and I change through them pretty routinely, adding new ones as I go. 
                    However, there are some interests that've stuck with me throughout the years.</p>

                    <h3> Art & Digital Art</h3>
                    <p> I've been drawing and painting for about as long as I can remember. Recently, I've delved into oil painting (as you can see below)</p>

                    <h3> Videogames </h3>
                    <p> I've been playing videogames for as long as I can remember. What started with comandeering my dad's PS2 to play Spyro
                        turned into a life-long passion. While I mainly stick to RPG games, I find mysefl enjoying almost anything - though, 
                    I'll admit that FPS games aren't my favorite thing.  </p>

                    <h3> Writing </h3>
                    <p> I've been writing my own stories since I was 12, and it's become somewhat of a common de-stressing activity for me 
                         to simply open a word document or grab a pen and paper and just head into a fantasy world within my mind, exploring it and it's
                        characters as I write. </p>
