                <p> I've been working on quite a lot of different things. I like to stay busy, and have a lot of in progress projects at any given time. 
                    This page will eventually come to host some of my finished works, as well as some notes as to things I'm in the progress of doing. </p>

                <p> As for now though, please take a look at my <a href = https://github.com/KaiConrad> GitHub</a> to see
                what I've been working on lately. </p>
